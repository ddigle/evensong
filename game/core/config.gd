## Game-wide constants.
##
## Three kinds, kept apart so the human can review them (game/README.md "임시값"):
##   ●  decided in docs/ (binding)
##   PROVISIONAL  a docs proposal (○) or open question (?) that M1 needs a value for. Each one names
##                the doc that leaves it open. Change it only after the human decides.
##   IMPL  an implementation choice made by an agent (not a design decision).

# --- ● decided ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ● 16px tiles (gameplay-design §3.1, R18).
const TILE: int = 16
## ● internal resolution 480x270, viewport stretch, integer scale, aspect expand (game-concept §7·§13, R31).
const VIEW_SIZE: Vector2i = Vector2i(480, 270)
## ● default window = 4x at 1080p (game-concept §7, R31).
const WINDOW_SIZE: Vector2i = Vector2i(1920, 1080)
## ● up to 9 players (game-concept §7, R11). Enforced by the host (stage G3).
const MAX_PLAYERS: int = 9
## ● slice classes (game-concept §12, R23).
const CLASSES: PackedStringArray = ["paladin", "miner", "archer", "cleric", "herbalist"]

# --- PROVISIONAL (○ / ?) --------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROVISIONAL (○ surface size not decided, gameplay-design §3.1 R12 "경계 있는 하나의 연속 맵").
## Surface start area in tiles.
const MAP_SIZE: Vector2i = Vector2i(128, 96)
## PROVISIONAL (? altar safe radius not decided, game-concept §7·§9.3; spike used 7 tiles = 112 px).
const SAFE_RADIUS_TILES: int = 7
## PROVISIONAL (○ R29 altar footprint 3x3 tiles, concept-art-brief §5.7).
const ALTAR_FOOTPRINT: Vector2i = Vector2i(3, 3)
## PROVISIONAL (○ fields inside the altar light, game-concept §9.7 / gameplay-design §3.8).
## Tilled soil patches the generator places inside the safe radius: count and size range (tiles).
const SOIL_PATCH_COUNT: int = 3
const SOIL_PATCH_MIN: Vector2i = Vector2i(2, 2)
const SOIL_PATCH_MAX: Vector2i = Vector2i(4, 3)
## PROVISIONAL (● 2~3 fixed corruption zones, game-concept §12; the count inside that range,
## their size and distance are not decided).
const ASH_ZONE_COUNT: int = 3
const ASH_ZONE_RADIUS_MIN: int = 5
const ASH_ZONE_RADIUS_MAX: int = 8
## PROVISIONAL (not in docs): grass tiles kept between the safe radius and any ash cell.
const ASH_CLEARANCE_TILES: int = 4

# --- IMPL (agent choices) -------------------------------------------------------------------

## IMPL: seed used when no --seed is given.
const DEFAULT_SEED: int = 1
## IMPL: ground view chunk size in display cells (TileMapLayer per chunk, spike RESULTS §3).
const GROUND_CHUNK: int = 32
## IMPL: TileMapLayer rendering quadrant for ground chunks (a canvas item takes at most 15 lights,
## spike RESULTS §4; 8 cells = 128 px squares).
const GROUND_QUADRANT: int = 8
## IMPL: weight of each inner-tile variant against the plain Wang tile (weight 1).
const VARIANT_WEIGHT: float = 0.25
## IMPL: ash edge raggedness: noise amplitude in tiles and frequency per tile.
const ASH_EDGE_NOISE_TILES: float = 3.0
const ASH_EDGE_NOISE_FREQUENCY: float = 0.2
## IMPL: free camera pan speed (px/s) in world.tscn until players exist (stage G2).
const FREE_CAMERA_SPEED: float = 240.0
## IMPL: default host port for --host (stage G3). Tests use 24621-24640.
const DEFAULT_PORT: int = 24600
